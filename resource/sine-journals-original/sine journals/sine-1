This being our first meeting, and my first time providing documentation, a brief exposition is required.

Although we gnomes have long kept a Pact not to interact with those more short-lived races, this Pact has been degrading ever since the end of our monarchy 337 years ago, in the year 222.

It was fully 200 years later, in 422, that we would emerge from the tops of the tallest trees, the deepest caverns, and be discovered by the Dwarves.  We had succesfully augured the War of Three Hammers just prior, so we decided we had a duty to come forth and share our knowledge.  The Bronzebeards were appreciative of this gesture, but they banned most gnomish magicks from being practiced in Ironforge.

Thus this humble Society was formed, wherever we may land, to better predict that catastrophic event, the Sinusoid.  We shall use the most wiliest and cleverest of minds in Azeroth, whether our life or limbs may be at stake in so doing.<Icon,01.3001695871353,C>


<<<3>>>
Most folks are not familiar with the Sinusoid, or Sine, of course, so it was no surprise that Ironforge was too proud to admit that we had predicted the War.  However, we've been able to convince a few of the Rujm Barish clan members of Loch Modan to aid us here in Westfall with our studies; they are a precious few.  The Society now numbers six members.

The Sine of course, is that most ancient of gnomish prophecies that predicts the very tides of history.  It goes by many names: The Sinusoidal Serpent, The Great Wheel, the Phoenix are but a few.

If we successfully augured it's recurrences and resonations, we could avoid the inevitable catastrophes that have plagued us in the past, and even put the Lid back on the Jar that these demonic forces seem to be perpetually sprouting from.  I will be keeping scrupulous notes on our techniques and findings.

P.S. We shall be adjourning to Duskwood shortly, as this drought shows no signs of letting up.
