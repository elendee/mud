Part I
Crop Rotations in Duskwood

You have your choice of crops here, though they are not many.  The most profitable I've found are fungi, mushrooms, algae and moss colonies.  You may miss the sunflowers and wheat stalks of Westfall, but you'll go broke trying to grow them here.  The more anaerobic the better, and you can fetch a decent price for them at the Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind.

Though, I know you are not here for crop cycles.   

I had to put that on the first page to deter any prying eyes - in fact we have to take all the precautions we can these days.  

You are here, most likely, about the Other Thing.<img src="Interface/WorldMap/Duskwood/TheDarkenedBank1" align="right" width="286" height="196" />

We have been studying IT deeply, but I cannot go into it much here.  Terring would like to make a computinker to study it, and Hizen is afraid we may interfere with it merely by studying it, and GÃ¶del is not sure it can be  studied at all.  

But that is all I can say, because I am not sure who you are, my dear Reader.  

And if you are one of the Quants, as we call them, I've said too much already.  <img src="Interface/ARCHEOLOGY/ArchRare-DraeneiRelic" align="center" width="256" height="128" />

<<<4>>>
I'm afraid it's going to get rather complicated from here on out.  These Quants, you see, they are always counting.  They are ten, and together form the Quantitative Creep, a force more unstoppable than gravity itself..  

They are counting all the time; they count our soldiers of course, and they count our armies, but they don't stop there.  No one knows where they came from, or why they do what they do, but it is clear that if they had their way, their counting would stop the Great Wheel itself.

They are prophesied by the great Gnostics of Gnomeregan:

To count the wind, 
and the leaves on the trees, 
and all the words upon the breeze

To count the sky
and the birds in the air
and every distance from here to there

To count the earth
all the granite and clay
put it to scale, see what it weighs

To count the oceans
hard though it seems
harder yet will be counting all of our dreams

These are the things
that the End of Time wants
yet these are the things
that are counted by Quants


<<<6>>>
My Dear Reader, you must NOT be counted by these horrors...  You will know their presence from the dearth of life, and stillness of air that follows them.  

Nothing grows where they are, it is only put into a sort of limbo, until, after every possible number has been counted of it, it withers and dies , like a flame with no oxygen.

It would seem that the Creep is finding roots here in Duskwood.


<<<7>>>
Therefore, everything from here on out must be encrypted in such a way that only those MEANT to know about It, such as You, will be able to understand it.  Titans know the Creep would pay any price to amalgamate our studies into their Accursed Repository.

If all this seems rather obtuse, know that it is for our own protection.   

We are headed now to Stormwind post haste, leaving my wife and son Tesser out of this before they are counted too.  It would be a dark day if the Creep caught up to our little study group, but at least I may protect Tesser with ignorance for now, should he need to pick up the trail later on.

<<<8>>>
Take this journal to Stormwind, and show it to Donyal at the Great Library if he's still alive.  I plan to confer with him.  If he's not trustworthy I don't know who is.

We leave in three days.  

Signed,

O.A., A.T., W.H., K.G.,
